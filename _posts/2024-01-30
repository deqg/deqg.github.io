# PAC Learning Framework and Rademacher Complexity, Jan 31 (2-4 PM, Carver 305)
We will discuss the estimate of the generalization error in machine learning theory.
Continuing with our last discussion on the Monte-Carlo error estimate, 
we will see how the generalization error of machine learning is estimated.
